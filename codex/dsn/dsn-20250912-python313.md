# Decision Support Note (DSN)

**ID:** DSN-20250912-01  
**Title:** Stick with Python 3.13 as default  
**Date:** 2025-09-12  
**Status:** Accepted  

---

## Context
- Forward-looking baseline for MLX and modern typing features.  
- Keeps local dev consistent with `.python-version` and CI targets.  

## Options Considered
1. Python 3.13 (default)  
   - Pros: latest stdlib, performance, and typing; aligns with Apple MLX guidance.  
   - Cons: Some third-party libs may lag; contributors on older macOS might need pyenv.  
2. Python >=3.11  
   - Pros: broader compatibility; fewer local upgrades.  
   - Cons: Adds variability; harder to reason about features and perf gaps.  

## Decision
- Chosen option: A (Python 3.13).  
- Rationale: Prefer a single, modern baseline; we will downgrade case-by-case via DSNs if necessary.  

## Consequences
- Immediate impact: `pyproject.toml` keeps `>=3.13`; runbook and docs reflect 3.13.  
- Risks: Some users may need to install 3.13; MLX versions must remain compatible.  
- Mitigations: Provide pyenv instructions; open a DSN if we hit ecosystem constraints.  

## Follow-ups
- [ ] Review MLX compatibility when major versions update.  
- [ ] Add CI matrix note if/when we broaden support.  
- [ ] No superseded DSNs.
